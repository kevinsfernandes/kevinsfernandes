- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin Fernandes (@kevinsfernandes)
- 👀 I’m interested in Chess, Sports (playing basketball and soccer and watching some basketball) and reading about productivity.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on MERN: MongoDB (and PostgreSQL), Express, React, Node, except with the React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything someone thinks I could help out on that's interesting or where can provide value to someone.
